# Readable API Server

This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

## Running the Project

* One Terminal, Run API Server
   - `cd api-server`
   - `npm install`
   - `node server`

* Terminal 2,
  - cd frontend
  - npm install
  - npm start


## Instructions

Sort - see the click to sort on the columns that get do it
To update comment, click on the "edit comment" to get a input capable field
To delete comment, click on the "delete comment"
TO update the vote score (use the green/red around the number)
The rest should be clear from the UI.

Sorry it is a little messy but there was so little guidance that is was lots of hacking and googling :)
